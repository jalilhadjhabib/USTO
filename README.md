# Web Project - USTO-MB Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences Internship
This GitHub repository contains the project developed during my third year of Computer Science studies at CESI EXIA as part of my internship.

## Project Context
During my third year at CESI EXIA, I completed an internship at the Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences at the University of Science and Technology of Oran Mohamed Boudiaf (USTO-MB). My primary mission was to revamp the faculty's existing website, introducing modern design elements and new functionalities to improve the user experience for students, faculty members, and administrators.

## Repository Content
This repository consists of the codebase developed for the web application during my internship. It encompasses all the essential files for setting up and running the web application including HTML, CSS, JavaScript files and Laravel specific files. Please refer to the documentation within the code for more detailed explanations about specific segments of the code.

## Team Members
- **HADJHABIB Abdel Djalil**: Intern responsible for the project, carried out project design, development, and coordination.

## Conclusion
This project was a rich and rewarding experience, allowing me to apply my web development skills in a real-world setting and to make a meaningful contribution to the faculty. The end product is a modern, user-friendly website with enhanced features like an online registration and course browsing for students, content management for faculty members and administrators. It serves as an excellent example of the work I accomplished during my third year at CESI EXIA, reflecting my skills in web development and project management.
